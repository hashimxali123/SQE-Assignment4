# Test Automation

In software testing, test automation is the use of software separate from the software being tested
to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. Test
automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place,
or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually

# Unit Testing
In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source
code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures,
and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use

### Requirements:


##### 1- System should pass test cases.

1.1  System should pass 90% of the test cases.
1.2  System should so above 90% of the coverage.

#### 2- We should use jnuit for unit testing.

2.1  System should use jcoco version 1.8 for unit testing.
