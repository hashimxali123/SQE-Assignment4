# Test Automation

In software testing, test automation is the use of software separate from the software being tested
to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. Test
automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place,
or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually

# Unit Testing
In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source
code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures,
and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use

### Requirements:


### 1- System should pass test cases.

#### 1.1  System should pass 90% of the test cases. 
#### 1.2  System should so above 90% of the coverage.

### 2- We should use jnuit for unit testing.

#### 2.1  System should use jcoco version 1.8 for unit testing.


# UI Testing

UI Testing, also known as GUI Testing is basically a mechanism meant to test the aspects of any software that a user will come into contact with. This usually means testing the visual elements to verify that they are functioning according to requirements – in terms of functionality and performance. UI testing ensures that UI functions are bug-free.

### 1- System shall perform UI testing with .

#### 1.1  System should able to berform UI testing with "Behave" and "Gherkin" Liabraries.

# API Testing

Software development now revolves around APIs, which link and transmit data and functionality between many systems and applications. Fortunately, testing these can significantly increase the effectiveness of any testing procedure in general and enable you to produce software more quickly than ever.

### 1- The system should able to test api whith the help of java api package.

#### The api should be able to respond within the 10 secounds of the request
