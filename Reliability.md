# Reliability Requirements

eliability requirements are typically part of a technical specifications document. 
They can be requirements that a company sets for its product and its own engineers or what
it reports as its reliability to its customers. They can also be requirements set for suppliers or subcontractors.

## SAIFI 

SAIFI is the average number of interruptions that a customer would experience, and is calculated as.
where is the failure rate and is the number of customers for location . In other words, SAIFI is measured in 
units of interruptions per customer. It is usually measured over the course of a year, and according to IEEE 
Standard 1366-1998 the median value for North American utilities is approximately 1.10 interruptions per customer.

#### 1- System average frequency index should be arounf 1.10.


## SAIDI

SAIDI is the average outage duration for each customer served, and is calculated as: where is the number of customers
and is the annual outage time for location , and is the total number of customers served. In other words, SAIDI is measured
in units of time, often minutes or hours. It is usually measured over the course of a year, and according to IEEE Standard 1366-1998 the
median value for North American utilities is approximately 1.50 hours.

#### 1- System averae intruption duration index should be arrounf 1.5 hours.


## CAIDI

The Customer Average Interruption Duration Index ( CAIDI) is a reliability index commonly used by electric power utilities.
It is related to SAIDI and SAIFI, and is calculated as where is the failure rate, is the number of customers, and is the annual outage time for location

#### 1- Customer average intruption index should be around 3
